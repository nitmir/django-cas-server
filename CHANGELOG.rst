v0.6.1 - 2016-07-27
===================

commit: b168e0a6423c53de31aae6c444fa1d1c5083afa6

v0.6.0 - 2016-07-06
===================

commit: 4ad4d13baa4236c5cd72cc5216d7ff08dd361476

Added
-----
* Add a section describing service patterns options to README.rst
* Add a federation mode:
  When the settings CAS_FEDERATE is True, django-cas-server will offer to the user to choose its
  CAS backend to authenticate. Hence the login page do not display anymore a username/password form
  but a select form with configured CASs backend.
  This allow to give access to CAS supported applications to users from multiple organization
  seamlessly.

  It was originally developped to mach the need of https://ares.fr (Federated CAS at
  https://cas.ares.fr, example of an application using it as https://chat.myares.fr)

Fixed
-----
* Then a ticket was marked as obtained with the user entering its credentials (aka not by SSO), and
  the service did not require it, ticket validation was failing. Now, if the service do not require
  authentication to be renewed, both ticket with renewed authentication and non renewed
  authentication validate successfully.



v0.5.0 - 2016-07-01
===================

commit: e3ab64271b718a17e4cbbbabda0a2453107a83df

Added
-----
* Add more password scheme support to the mysql authentication backend: ldap user
  attribute scheme encoding and simple password hash in hexa for md5, sha1, sha224,
  sha256, sha384, sha512.
* Add a main heading to template "Central Authentication Service" with a logo controled
  by CAS_LOGO_URL
* Add logos to the project (svg, png)
* Add coverage computation
* link project to codacy
* Update doc: add debian requirement, correct typos, correct links

Changed
-------
* Use settings to set tests username password and attributes
* Tweak the css and html for small screens
* Update travis cache for faster build
* clean Makefile, use pip to install, add target for tests

Fixed
-----
* Fix "warn me": we generate the ticket after the user agree to be connected to the service.
  we were generating first and the connect button was a link to the service url with the ?ticket=
  this could lead to situation where the ticket validity expire if the user is slow to click the
  connect button.
* Fix authentication renewal: the renew parameter were not transmited when POST the login request
   and self.renew (aks for auth renewal) was use instead of self.renewed (auth was renewd)
   when generating a ticket.
* Fix attribute value replacement when generating a ticket: we were using the 'name' attribute
  instead of the 'attribut' attribut on ReplaceAttributValue
* Fix attribute value replacement when generating a ticket then the value is a list: iterate over
  each element of the list.
* Fix a NameError in utils.import_attr
* Fix serviceValidate and samlValidate when user_field is an attribute that is a list: we use
  the first element of the list as username. we were serializing the list before that.
* Correct typos


Cleaned
-------
* Clean some useless conditional branches found with coverage
* Clean cas.js: use compact object declararion
* Use six for python{2|3} compatibility
* Move all unit tests to cas_server.tests and use django primitive. We also have a 100% tests
  coverage now. Using the django classes for tests, we do not need to use our own dirty mock.
* Move mysql backend password check to a function in utils


v0.4.4 - 2016-04-30
===================

commit: 77d1607b0beefe8b171adcd8e2dcd974e3cdc72a

Added
-----
* Add sensitive_post_parameters and sensitive_variables for passwords, so passwords are anonymised
  before django send an error report.
  
Fixed
-----
* Before commit 77fc5b5 the User model had a foreign key to the Session model. After the commit,
  Only the session_key is store, allowing to use different backend than the Session SQL backend.
  So the first migration (which is 21 migrations combined) was creating the User model with the
  foreign key, then delete it and add the field session_key. Somehow, MySQL did not like it.
  Now the first migration directly create the User model with the session_key and without the
  foreign key to the Session SQL backend.
* Evaluate attributes variables in the template samlValidate.xml. the {{ }} was missing causing
  the variable name to be displyed instead of the variable content.
* Return username in CAS 1.0 on the second ligne of the CAS response as specified.


Changed
-------
* Update tests


v0.4.3 - 2016-03-18
===================

commit: f6d436acb49f8d32b5457c316c18c4892accfd3b

Fixed
-----
* Currently, one of our dependancy, django-boostrap3, do not support django 1.7 in its last version.
  So there is some detection of the current django installed version in setup.py to pin 
  django-boostrap3 to a version supported by django 1.7 if django 1.7 is installed, or to require
  at least django 1.8.
  The detection did not handle the case where django was not installed.
* [PEP8] Put line breaks after binary operator and not before.


v0.4.2 - 2016-03-18
===================

commit: d1cd17d6103281b03a8c57013671057eab80d21c

Added
-----
* On logout, display the number of sessions we are logged out from.

Fixed
-----
* One of our dependancy, django-boostrap3, do not support django 1.7 in its last version.
  Some django version detection is added to setup.py to handle that.
* Some typos
* Make errors returned by utils.import_attr clearer (as they are likely to be displayed to the
  django admin)


v0.4.1 - 2015-12-23
===================

commit: 5e63f39f9b7c678a300ad2f8132166be34d1d35b

Added
-----
* Add a run_test_server target to make file. Running make run_test_server will build a virtualenv,
  create a django projet with django-cas-server and lauch ./management.py runserver. It is quite
  handy to test developement version.
* Add verbose name for cas_server app and models
* Add Makefile clean targets for tox tests and test virtualenv.
* Add link on license badge to the GPLv3

Changed
-------
* Make Makefile clean targets modular
* Use img.shields.io for PyPi badges
* Get django-cas-server version in Makefile directly from setup.py (so now, the version is only
  written in one place)

Fixed
-----
* Fix MysqlAuthUser when number of results != 1: In that case, call super anyway this the provided
  username.
